"""Announcing new Reddit posts in a Discord channel.

One row of `reddit_feeds` is one watch: a Reddit user or a subreddit, the
channel it announces in, the text it announces with, and who gets pinged. The
loop below reads each watch's public Atom feed every few minutes and posts
whatever it has not posted before.

**It announces, and that is all it does.** A message that asks the channel to go
and upvote is vote manipulation under Reddit's content policy, and it is the
group of accounts answering the call — not just the poster — that gets banned
for it; the pattern is trivially visible in the voting timeline whatever the
message says. So there is no vote wording anywhere in here, and the template
help on the web page says the same thing. Commenting and discussion are fine,
and count for more in Reddit's own ranking than a handful of early votes.

`check_feed()` is the whole implementation: the loop calls it, and so does the
**Check now** button on the web page, so a manual check does exactly what the
scheduled one does.
