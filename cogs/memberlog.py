"""Announcements when someone joins, leaves, is kicked, banned or unbanned.

Two things decide whether this does anything at all:

* **The members intent.** `on_member_join` and `on_member_remove` are privileged.
  `bot.py` only requests the intent when `MEMBER_EVENTS` is set, because
  requesting one that isn't ticked in the Developer Portal makes the bot fail to
  start — so joins and leaves stay silent until it is deliberately switched on.
  Bans and unbans need no privileged intent and work either way.
* **A configured channel.** Nothing is posted until `log_settings.channel_id` is
  set for the guild, which the web UI does.

On top of that, `on_member_join` also greets the member directly — a public
message in `log_settings.welcome_channel_id` and/or a DM, entirely independent
of the staff-facing join log above. Neither needs the other switched on, and
either one needs its own privileged-intent check the join log already does.
See `render_welcome()` and `_send_welcome()`.
