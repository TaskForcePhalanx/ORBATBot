"""Bulk message deletion — `/purge`.

Deletes messages in the channel the command is run in, either the last *N* of
them or everything posted since a given point in time. Both can be combined,
in which case the count is a cap on the window.

Two Discord rules shape everything here:

* **Bulk deletion only works on messages younger than 14 days.** Anything older
  has to be deleted one at a time, which is rate limited to roughly one message
  a second — so old messages are capped at `MAX_SLOW_DELETES` per run rather
  than silently keeping the command busy for half an hour.
* **Nothing deleted can be recovered**, which is why the command previews the
  exact set first and only touches it after a confirmation click.
