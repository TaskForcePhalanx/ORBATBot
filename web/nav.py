"""The tab bar, built once here instead of three times in Jinja.

The site grew past the point where one flat row of tabs reads as anything: by
the eighth tab nobody can see that Operation, Slot Approvals and ORBATs are
three views of the same thing. So the tabs are a two-level structure, and it is
built in Python because the shape of it — which groups exist, what each one
lands on, who may see it — is the kind of thing that goes wrong when it is
spread across template conditionals.

`build()` returns everything `_nav.html` needs:

    groups    the top row, in order
    items     group key → the second row for that group
    group_of  page key → the group it belongs to, so a page only has to name
              itself and the nav works out where that sits
