"""The tactical map behind the browser pages.

What a map *is* — the symbols, the document, the drawing — lives in
`utils/tacmap.py`, which imports nothing. This module is the part that knows
about guilds, share links and Discord: it translates form fields and saved
documents into that library's calls and back, and a `ValueError` raised here is
a message meant for the person looking at the page.

### The share link is the whole credential

`/m/{token}` is reachable without signing in, which is the point — the people
who need tonight's plan are in Discord, not necessarily on this site, and
plan-ops-style links are what everyone already expects. So the token is long,
random and revocable: regenerating it is what un-shares a map that has been
forwarded further than intended, and `share_mode` decides whether that link may
draw or only look.
