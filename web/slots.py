"""Deciding slot requests from the browser: approve, deny, release, assign.

Every rule about who may decide what, and everything a decision entails — the
roster write, clearing #slot-approvals, the archive record, the DMs, the
competing requests, the board refresh — lives in `cogs/slots.py` and is called
from here. Releasing a slot is the same story with a third function: this page
and `/clear-slot` both go through `clear_slot_request()`. This module only reads
the queue and translates errors, the way `web/service.py` does for events.

That matters more here than anywhere else on the site: an approval is the one
action with consequences in four places at once, and a second implementation of
it for the web would be exactly where the two surfaces drift apart.
